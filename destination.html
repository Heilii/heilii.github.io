    <h1>Fethiye</h1>
    <p>
      Fethiye is a coastal city famous for its beautiful beaches and relaxed
      small city vibes. If you are into cities that have tons to offer their
      visitors but still don’t look like they’re built for tourism, Fethiye is
      the perfect place for you. Here you can soak up some sun on the beach,
      hike around ancient tombs, and jump off of cliffs with a parachute!
      Fethiye has an ideal Mediterranean climate where summers are hot and dry,
      and winters are warm and rainy. Temperatures in the winter range from 8 to
      15 degrees. In summer months, temperatures are generally between 25 and 35
      degrees. Autumn in Fethiye is usually pleasantly warm, and early autumn is
      still a great time to swim in the sea. The spring temperatures range
      between 15 and 25 degrees, and spring is often considered the best time to
      go on hikes around the ancient Lycian trails near the city. Fethiye is
      famous for its beautiful sea and beaches, but it also has a lot of ancient
      history to discover and enjoy. Fethiye’s beautiful trails seem always to
      have a new surprise. This is the reason why a lot of expats choose Fethiye
      as a place to settle. Though not expats, our team also decided to settle
      in Fethiye after a long stint in big cities and some time abroad. For this
      reason, the information I’ll give on the places is entirely from
      experience, except for the section on paragliding.
